# Human Activity Recognition Smartphones Means and Standard Deviations

This package performs an analysis of a snapshot of data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UC Irvine.

It contains a single R script, **run_analysis.R**, that generates a single large dataframe of all mean and standard deviation measurements from both the training and test sets. It also generates a summary data frame that gives the means of all the measurements for each subject and activity tuple.
